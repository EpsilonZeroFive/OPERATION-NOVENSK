	"Name": "Custom 5.56x45 20-round Aluminum Magazine with Sand-colored Magpul Mag Assist for M4A1",
	"ShortName": "Custom 20rd Mag with Magpul Assist",
	"Description": "Originally used by the US military for the M16 during the Vietnam War, the 20-round straight magazine was later replaced with the 30-round magazine due to issues like insufficient firepower and magazine strength. After custom modifications for the M4A1, a sand-colored Magpul mag assist was added to the bottom for quick magazine changes."
