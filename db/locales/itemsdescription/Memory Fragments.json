	"Description": "Data generated during humanoid mental organization, which can be used to upgrade the humanoid's mental space after screening. The batch of memory fragments sent to Norvinsk has been condensed and optimized, where one fragment is equivalent to one hundred original fragments. It is said that this is due to the inadequacy of the software used by Norvinsk's machines, leading to data loss when processing large amounts of scattered data. Therefore, the scattered memory fragments must first be read and integrated in Griffin before being sent to Norvinsk."
