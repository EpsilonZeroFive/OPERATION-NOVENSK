	"ShortName": "New Fire Control Component",
	"Description": "IOP has specially developed this reinforced component for advanced T-Dolls with sufficient expansion space. Still in the debugging phase, the quantity is very limited. It can be used for the mental upgrade of high-star T-Dolls. After processing by Griffin, these new fire control components can be conveniently installed in places like Tarkov, where both hardware and software are insufficient."
