	"Description": "The Colt M4A1 is an American carbine rifle designed based on the AR-15 platform, utilizing the 5.56x45 NATO cartridge. Initially targeted at vehicle crews and fireteams needing a lighter and more compact weapon than standard full-size rifles, the M4A1 quickly became the standard-issue firearm for US SOCOM (United States Special Operations Command) and subsequently for the US Army and Marine Corps. This rifle features a custom FDE (Flat Dark Earth) paint job with the I.O.P. logo on it."
