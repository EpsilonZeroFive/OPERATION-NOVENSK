	"Description": "Damage: 78    Penetration: 28                                                                                                            .40S&W is a new cartridge derived from the 10mm bullet, with the same caliber of 10mm but shorter length and less gunpowder. Originally intended to replace the 9x19PARA and .45ACP cartridges, it is relatively expensive due to its late introduction and lack of sufficient support. This is the FMJ variant of the .40S&W cartridge."
