	"ShortName": "M4A1 MOD1",
	"Description": "The Colt M4A1 is a carbine rifle designed by the United States based on the AR-15 platform, using 5.56x45 NATO ammunition. Initially targeted at vehicle crew members and fire teams, who needed a lighter and more compact weapon than the standard full-size rifle. However, the US SOCOM (United States Special Operations Command) quickly decided to equip all subordinate units with the M4A1, making it the standard weapon for the US Army and Marine Corps. This rifle has undergone the first modification using a four-star rifle modification template, focusing on reducing recoil, improving stability during shooting, enhancing human-machine efficiency, and doubling the maintenance cost."
