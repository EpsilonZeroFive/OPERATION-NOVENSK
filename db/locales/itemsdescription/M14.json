	"Name": "M14 7.62x51 Designated Marksman Rifle",
	"ShortName": "M14",
	"Description": "The M14, based on the M1 Garand, was developed after World War II. It uses the powerful 7.62x51mm cartridge, offering high accuracy but with significant recoil. It was replaced by the M16 in the Vietnam War due to its unsuitability for the US military's operational requirements. Later, the US military modified it into a semi-automatic sniper rifle, where it performed well in combat."
