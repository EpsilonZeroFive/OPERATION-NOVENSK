	"Description": "Damage: 98    Penetration: 35                                                                                                            The .50AE cartridge is an upgrade of the .44 Magnum, with bullets that possess tremendous kinetic energy. However, its significant recoil and excessive power make it unsuitable for tactical or self-defense purposes but rather more suitable for hunting medium or large game. This is the Full Metal Jacket variant of the .50AE cartridge, featuring a full metal jacket projectile."
