	"ShortName": "OTs-12",
	"Description": "The OTs-12 is a short assault rifle based on the AKS-74U, utilizing 9x39mm special subsonic ammunition. Its compact design and use of subsonic ammunition make it well-suited for indoor or special operations. It received high praise during its initial production but ultimately did not enter mass production. Since then, many have attempted to recreate the OTs-12 by modifying the AKS-74U."
