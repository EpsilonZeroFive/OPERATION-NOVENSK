	"Name": "Colt 5.56x45 20-round Aluminum Magazine with Sand-colored Magpul Mag Assist",
	"ShortName": "Colt Mag with Magpul Assist",
	"Description": "Originally used by the US military for the M16 during the Vietnam War, the 20-round straight magazine was later replaced with the 30-round magazine due to issues like insufficient firepower and magazine strength. A sand-colored Magpul mag assist was added to the bottom of the magazine for quick magazine changes."
