	"Name": "HK 416 5.56x45 Assault Rifle",
	"ShortName": "HK416",
	"Description": "The HK416 is a new type of assault rifle developed by HK based on the M4 carbine. The most significant difference compared to the AR-15 family is the use of a short-stroke gas piston system, which enhances the HK416's reliability over the AR-15. It also addresses the issue of excessive gas blowback common in traditional AR-15 rifles when suppressors are attached."
