	"Description": "Colt developed the Colt Model 635 submachine gun chambered in 9x19mm to enter the submachine gun market. This submachine gun is based on the M16A2 and shares a similar structure, but the Model 635 uses a free recoil bolt, so there are no gas ports or gas tubes on the barrel. Later, the Model 635 was renamed RO635."
