	"ShortName": "S-SASS",
	"Description": "The ArmaLite AR-10 developed by ArmaLite company uses 7.62x51 NATO rounds and has a similar appearance to the M16. The AR-10 failed in the 1956 selection experiments and was subsequently improved twice by Colt. However, due to the rise of small-caliber rifles at the time, the AR-10 was discontinued. It wasn't until the 1990s that precision marksman rifles in 7.62 caliber gained popularity, and ArmaLite also introduced a modified version of the AR-10, the AR-10B. In 2005, ArmaLite presented the AR-10 SASS for bidding against the M110 SASS, but the AR-10 SASS was not selected. Later, ArmaLite introduced a new version of the AR-10 called the “Super SASS” for civilian and law enforcement markets."
