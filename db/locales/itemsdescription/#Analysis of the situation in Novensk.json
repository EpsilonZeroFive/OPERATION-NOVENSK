	"Description": "The main powers in Novinsk currently include TERRAGROUP LABS, USEC, BEAR, and SCAVs composed of local bandits, as well as the relatively obscure 'Fence' organization. USEC is hired by TERRAGROUP LABS; BEAR was established by the post-Soviet government to counter the illegal activities of TERRAGROUP LABS. USEC and BEAR are in hostile relations with each other, while SCAVs oppose USEC and BEAR for survival and personal gain, closely allied with 'Fence'. To conduct certain illegal research, TERRAGROUP hired USEC PMC as its primary employer. After the Third War, TERRAGROUP and USEC PMC entered Novinsk in 2051 and established TERRAGROUP LABS in Takov for illegal experiments, resulting in local chaos and the rise of gangs. Local residents, influenced by the gangs, joined them in large numbers, becoming SCAVs. The post-Soviet authorities decided to confront the illegal actions of TERRAGROUP and USEC. To prevent escalation to political confrontation, the post-Soviet authorities established BEAR Private Military Company in 2059, with BEAR PMC deployed in Novinsk in October 2060. The intense conflict between USEC and BEAR was termed the Contract War. BEAR once breached TERRAGROUP LABS during their conflict with USEC. Prior to this, USEC had killed numerous TERRAGROUP LABS researchers and attempted to clear all experimental data and samples. After breaching TERRAGROUP LABS, BEAR collected a significant amount of experimental data and samples that were not yet destroyed. During BEAR's retreat, they were ambushed by USEC, resulting in mutual losses and the loss of remaining experimental data and samples, leading to a stalemate in the Novinsk situation."
