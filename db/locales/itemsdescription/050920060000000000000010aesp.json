	"Description": "Damage: 127    Penetration: 18                                                                                                            The .50AE cartridge is an upgrade of the .44 Magnum, with bullets that possess tremendous kinetic energy. However, its significant recoil and excessive power make it unsuitable for tactical or self-defense purposes but rather more suitable for hunting medium or large game. This is the Hollow Point variant of the .50AE cartridge, featuring a projectile that rapidly expands upon impact, causing significant wound trauma."
